This is a test that we can deal with files and copy files from one place to another
We want to be able to specify a local source for the files and copy them to a "bucket".

	target copyFilesToBucket
		ensure test.S3.Bucket "org.ziniki.launch_bucket" => bucket
		env "GOLDEN_ROOT" => root
		files.dir root "filesrc" => src_dir
		files.copy src_dir bucket

Now test that the named bucket has the files it should have

		test.assertBucketHas bucket
			"hello.txt"
